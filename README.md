# BackgroundServices
This repository contains examples of implementing background services using three libraries: Hangfire, Coravel, and Quartz. Each of these libraries offers unique features and capabilities that cater to various scheduling and background task scenarios in .NET applications.

- **Hangfire**: A robust library that allows easy scheduling and execution of background jobs. It supports delayed and recurring tasks with a simple interface and provides a dashboard for monitoring job execution.

- **Coravel**: Known for its simplicity, Coravel offers task scheduling and caching features, making it ideal for lightweight background processing without the need for an external service.

- **Quartz**: A highly flexible and feature-rich library that allows detailed cron-based scheduling. It's suitable for complex scheduling needs with fine-grained control over job execution.
